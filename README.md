## Why React?

We chose React due to it's huge market share, aswell as for personal gain due to React being in the majority of job adverts.

As mentioned in an article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@TechMagic/reactjs-vs-angular5-vs-vue-js-what-to-choose-in-2018-b91e028fa91d), React is mentioned in 78.1% of open job positions, out of 60.000.

Also, React seemed the easiest to get started with.
Vue is relatively new and doesn't have as much documentation online about how to use it, and we read that Angular was quite heavy for "beginners".
